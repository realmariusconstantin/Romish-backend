// Simulation script removed.
// Per repository policy and user request, automated simulation scripts have been removed
// to avoid accidental load or rate-limit issues against the development or staging servers.
// If you need to run local simulations for testing, please restore an archived copy from
// version control or create tests under a dedicated test-only folder that cannot run in
// production environments.
